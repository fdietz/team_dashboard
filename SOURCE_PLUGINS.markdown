# Team Dashboard Source Plugins

Data Source Plugins for [Team Dashboard](https://github.com/fdietz/team_dashboard)

## Implement your own Data Source Plugin
You will find example plugins for each type of data source. Use these to get started quickly.

Following an overview of the existing data source types.

### Datapoints
The datapoints source supports data for rendering graphs and aggregated values. Following a minimal implementation.

    class Example < Sources::Datapoints::Base
      def get(targets, from, to, options = {})
        result = []
        targets.each do |target|
          # retrieve the actual data here
          result << { 'target' => "demo.example1", 'datapoints' => [[1, 123456], [7, 123466]] }
        end
        result
      end

      def available_targets(options = {})
        ["demo.example1", "demo.example2"]
      end

      def supports_target_browsing?
        true
      end
    end

Note the datapoints array consists of pairs of number values (y-value and timestamp for the x-value of the graph). This is similar to how Graphite or Ganglia structure their json data for graph data.

For datapoints sources it makes sense to enable users to browse them easily. The widget editor dialog features an autosuggest textfield. it requires the <code>available_targets</code> method to return an array of strings. Additionally <code>supports_target_browsing?</code> should return true.

### CI (Continous Integration Server)
The CI data source delivers build status results.

    class Demo < Sources::Ci::Base
      def get(options = {})
        {
          :label             => "Demo name",
          :last_build_time   => Time.now.iso8601,
          :last_build_status => 0, # success
          :current_status    => 1  # building
        }
      end
    end

### Number
The number data source supports a single integer value, an optional label and an optional color.

    class Example < Sources::Number::Base
      def get(options = {})
        # retrieve actual data here
        { :value => 115, :label => "example label", :color => "#FFF" }
      end
    end

### Boolean
The boolean data source supports a single boolean value and an optional label.

    class Example < Sources::Boolean::Base
      def get(options = {})
        # retrieve actual data here
        { :value => true, :label => "example label" }
      end
    end

### Global configuration for your data source
It some cases it makes sense to have a global configuration in the Rails app instead of a separate option as part of the widget configuration.

There is a global `config/backend_settings.yml` that takes care of that. Just add entries for your own plugin if that makes sense.

Let's have a look at how its done for for the Graphite data source. There's an entry in `config/backend_settings.yml`.

    graphite:
      url: "http://some.url"

This is automatically assigned to the `BackendSettings` constant throughout your application.

The graphite data source now can easily access the configuration. In order to determine if the data source is configured correctly you have to implement the <code>available?</code> method:

    class Graphite < Sources::Datapoints::Base
      def available?
        BackendSettings.secrets.graphite_url.present?
      end
    end

Only if <code>available?</code> returns true will the data source be available in the widget editor.

### Widget Configuration Params defined in Data Source
Quite often its necessary to add a configuration option in the widget creation step which gets passed along to the data source plugin.

For example the official [Jenkins source plugin](https://github.com/fdietz/team_dashboard/blob/master/app/models/sources/ci/jenkins.rb) specifies two additional fields <code>server_url</code> and <code>project</code>:

    class Jenkins < Sources::Ci::Base

      def custom_fields
        [
          { :name => "server_url", :title => "Server Url", :mandatory => true },
          { :name => "project", :title => "Project", :mandatory => true },
        ]
      end

      def get(options = {})
        fields = options.fetch(:fields)
        result = request_build_status(fields.fetch(:server_url), fields.fetch(:project))
        {
          :label             => result["fullDisplayName"],
          :last_build_time   => result["lastBuildTime"],
          :last_build_status => status(result["result"]),
          :current_status    => current_status(result["building"])
        }
      end

      # ... more code here
    end

Note how the fields method returns an array of configuration params. Each param is specified by a technical <code>name</code> and the <code>title</code> and a boolean flag <code>mandatory</code> as shown above.

Whenever you specify additional fields they will automatically show up in the widget editor dialog and stored in the database for you. Note, that the <code>get</code> method fetches these params again via the options hash. By convention all addition fields are separated from the default fields with the <code>fields</code> namespace.
