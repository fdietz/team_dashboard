# Number Widgets

## Jira Filter Counter

### Configuration

Add Jira URL, User and Passwort to `config/application.js` or set `JIRA_URL`, `JIRA_USER` and `JIRA_PASSWORD` for your environment.

### Usage

Create a Search Filter in your Jira installation and remember the Filter ID (`requestId` in URL when viewing the filter). Paste this ID to the numner widget. That's it.
